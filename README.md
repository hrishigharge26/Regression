# Regression
Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. 
If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. 
Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random Forests Regression.

In this repository I have uploaded following regression techniques:

Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
